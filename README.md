Issue Statement


A heavy-duty vehicle's Air Pressure System (APS) is a crucial part that uses compressed air to push a piston and provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down.
The ease of obtaining and long-term sustainability of natural air make an APS preferable to a hydraulic system.


This is a binary classification problem, in which the positive class denotes that a specific APS component was responsible for the failure while the negative class denotes that a different factor was responsible.

Suggestion of a Fix


The Air Pressure System (APS), which produces pressurised air used for numerous truck tasks including braking and gear shifting, is the system that this project is focused on.
